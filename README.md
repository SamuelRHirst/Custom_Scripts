#  Custom Scripts

This repository contains small, purpose-built scripts — mostly written in Python — developed to support genomics and multi-omics workflows.

These scripts are designed to:
- Reformat or clean raw data files
- Connect outputs between tools
- Extract relevant information from large omics datasets
- Perform lightweight calculations or summaries

They are meant to complement standard tools and fill in gaps where no existing solution quite fits.
